# viterbi_decoder_3to4conv
there is a cons_length =3 , [7,5] conv code encoder/viterbi decoder in main.c
and a 3/4conv encoder/decoder in main_drm3to4.c
currently working on multiple path tracing in viterbi cause algorithm finds the minimum distance path but this path isn't unique and we don't currently have a resolution for this.
